    Fill in your answer here

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This is because we want to know when the changes are made and then we want to update the repository.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Ans- We fork a repository from someone else;s github remote repo/profile
	We clone a repo from remote to local repo
	Branch is created for adding a new version that we want to test

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Ans - We can access the local copy of the required remote for fast-forward merge

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Ans- It will be harder to collaborate as integrating changes will be difficult.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

We would want to make changes in a seperate branch when we are not sure of the changes. Once they get confirmed, we can merge our branches.
