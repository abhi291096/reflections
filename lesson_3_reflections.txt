Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This is because we want to know when the changes are made and then we want to update the repository.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Ans- We fork a repository from someone else;s github remote repo/profile
	We clone a repo from remote to local repo
	Branch is created for adding a new version that we want to test
